# Preface

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed to provide students, educators, and developers with practical knowledge of modern robotics technologies including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Target Audience

This book serves multiple audiences:

- **Students**: Learn the fundamentals of physical AI and humanoid robotics through structured modules and practical examples
- **Educators**: Access curriculum-ready content with learning objectives, exercises, and lab recommendations
- **Developers**: Implement advanced robotics systems with detailed technical examples and best practices

## Book Structure

The book is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Core concepts and implementation
2. **Module 2: Digital Twins** - Simulation and the sim-to-real gap
3. **Module 3: AI Brain** - Perception and navigation systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Advanced AI integration

Each module builds upon previous knowledge while remaining accessible as a standalone learning unit.

## Learning Approach

This book emphasizes hands-on learning with:

- Reproducible code examples in Python and other languages
- Technical diagrams and visualizations
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Real-world applications and case studies
- Quality validation with peer-reviewed sources

## Technical Requirements

To follow along with examples in this book, you'll need:

- A computer capable of running ROS 2 (Ubuntu 22.04 or Windows with WSL2)
- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Access to appropriate hardware for practical exercises (requirements detailed in Appendix)

## Acknowledgments

This book was developed with input from the robotics and AI research community, with special thanks to the contributors who provided technical review and validation.
