# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Advanced AI Integration

## Overview

Module 4 explores Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that enable humanoid robots to understand and execute complex tasks through natural language interaction. This module covers voice-to-action pipelines, cognitive planning with large language models, multi-modal perception, and the integration of these components into a cohesive AI system for humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Design voice-to-action pipelines for humanoid robot control
2. Implement cognitive planning systems using large language models
3. Create multi-modal perception systems that combine vision and language
4. Integrate VLA components into a unified humanoid robot control system
5. Execute capstone projects demonstrating complete VLA functionality

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3 (all previous modules)
- Understanding of deep learning and natural language processing concepts
- Experience with Python and neural network frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow)

## Module Structure

This module contains five chapters that build your understanding of VLA systems:

1. **Chapter 1: Introduction to VLA Robotics** - Conceptual foundations
2. **Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action Pipeline** - Speech processing and action mapping
3. **Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning Using LLMs** - Language model integration
4. **Chapter 4: Multi-Modal Perception** - Vision-language fusion
5. **Chapter 5: Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete integration

## Technology Focus

This module focuses on:

- Speech recognition and natural language understanding
