# Module 1: ROS 2 - Physical AI Foundations

## Overview

Module 1 provides the foundational knowledge for working with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework that underlies most modern robotics applications. This module covers ROS 2 architecture, node creation, package management, robot description formats, and real-time control concepts essential for physical AI applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
2. Create and manage ROS 2 packages using rclpy
3. Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
4. Implement basic control systems for humanoid robots
5. Apply real-time control principles in ROS 2 environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- A working ROS 2 installation (Humble Hawksbill or Iron Irwini recommended)

## Module Structure

This module contains five chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

1. **Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Robotics Foundations** - Core concepts and setup
2. **Chapter 2: ROS 2 Architecture** - Nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. **Chapter 3: Building ROS 2 Packages with rclpy** - Practical implementation
4. **Chapter 4: Robot Description Formats (URDF for humanoid robots)** - Modeling humanoid robots
5. **Chapter 5: Real-Time Control Concepts** - Control systems for physical AI

## Technology Focus

This module focuses on:

- ROS 2 Python client library (rclpy)
- ROS 2 package management and build system (colcon)
- URDF for robot modeling
- TF (Transform) system for coordinate frames
- Real-time control principles

## Estimated Duration

- Total module time: 12-15 hours
- Per chapter: 2-3 hours
